"""
    This program listens for work messages contiously.


    We want know if (Condition To monitor):
    The smoker temperature decreases by more than 15 degrees F in 2.5 minutes (smoker alert!)
    Any food temperature changes less than 1 degree F in 10 minutes (food stall!)

    Three consumer processes, each one monitoring one of the temperature streams. 
    Perform calculations to determine if a significant event has occurred.

    Time Windows:
    Smoker time window is 2.5 minutes
    Food time window is 10 minutes

    Deque Max Length:
    At one reading every 1/2 minute, the smoker deque max length is 5 (2.5 min * 1 reading/0.5 min)
    At one reading every 1/2 minute, the food deque max length is 20 (10 min * 1 reading/0.5 min) 

    Three listening queues: 01-smoker, 02-food-A, 02-food-B
    Three listening callback functions: smoker_callback, fooda_callback, foodb_callback
